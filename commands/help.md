So... here are all the commands! 🙂️


` ping `       :    just try it out.
` pong `       :    says pingggggg.
` eval `       :    evaluates a mathematical expression.
` bye `        :    hmm.. i guess u can just try it.
` ok `         :    ok then
` hi `         :    says hello?
`tail or head` :    which one?
`roll`         :    rolls a die!
`random [x] [y]` : give a random number between number x and y 
`addCommad [command] [reply]`: adds custom command!
`deleteCommand [custom command]` : deletes custom command
`randNum`     : gives a 64bit random interger

**Note: for command random, x needs to be the smaller number and y the bigger number.
Making both the same number will not work!

Admin permissions are required for command deleteCommand.
